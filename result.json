    "NEW YORK, NY ‚Äì Recruitment to join the Proud Boys has surged. Last week, Joe Biden attempted to slander the fraternity as an extremist, white supremacist hate group at the first presidential debate.\n\nAfter Joe Biden‚Äôs mention, the Proud Boys were thrown into national attention, making it the top news story for several days after the Wednesday debate. Search engine requests for the term ‚ÄúProud Boys‚Äù spiked 17 times. According to the Long Island chapter of Proud Boys, applications for membership is up 1,200% compared to the week before the September 29th debate. \n\nInterest in the Proud Boys has grown over the years, especially since the upcoming election cycle. Before the debate, applications to join the club were already up in 2020 (120%) compared to the same time last year.\n\nThe Proud Boys are an international men‚Äôs drinking club, which promotes Western values. They have been the target of neoliberal establishment,"

Workout: The government and the enemy love for you to be out of shape, by doing some sort of exercise at least 4 times a week you will build muscle and endurance, which in turn will give you more energy!\n2. Get out of the city: Cities are where the vast majority of problem in any country are, obviously it may not be possible for you to leave due to work or financial difficulties, but do everything possible to get to a smaller less chaotic place to live.\n3. Spend money locally: Find independent businesses that look after you and the people around your area and buy from them instead of international corporations!\n4. Eat better: We all enjoy the odd takeaway or coffee, but too much of a good thing is bad for you. Schedule a meal out or takeaway once or twice a month your wallet and backside will thank you!\n5. Read: Start reading more and watch less television or movies, it will stimulate your brain in a much more positive way and it's a great way to relax!\n6. Stay away from negative people and build a small group of reliable friends: Avoid the haters, slackers, cry babies and typical wankers who slag off everything and wallow in negativity! Find some people who have motivation, ambition and skills, who are also switched on politically!\n7. Start a hobby or project: Break your day up with learning how to play guitar, drawing,gardening, cooking or something constructive. It will help you to grow and to focus on positive things!\n\nThis list is not definite but it is a great way to take back your life and throw off some reliance on the system and show others the human spirit is alive!"

See how many neurotic, unhinged students yell over him, calling him a \"homophobe,\" \"transphobe,\" and \"fascist.\"\n\nAs a side note, antifa advocates violence against anyone they deem a \"fascist,\" whose definition gets broader daily. They even recently killed a random Trump supporter. So if you oppose pedophilia, watch over your shoulder if you live in a liberal major city in the West.\n\nThis video constantly gets removed from YouTube, so please share this!\n\nüî¥ ",

    " Moving away from encouraging kids to get high scores on their tests or assignments. They are actively pushing teachers into suppressing the minds of our children, and not allowing them to achieve excellence or reach success. \n\nThe only avenue we have as parents is to go to the school and complain to the principle. If you really want to make a big deal, you‚Äôll climb the complaint ladder to the school board‚Ä¶ but then what? Depending on how radical the Liberal indoctrinators are, you could possibly be arrested or barred from ever stepping foot onto the property of your child‚Äôs school. If they‚Äôre less radical, that‚Äôs best case scenario. Best case scenario at best they smile in your face and say, ‚Äúthanks for the complaint, have a nice day.‚Äù And your complaint goes nowhere.\n\nIndicative to the communist agenda infiltrating the education system on all levels, they‚Äôre moving away from ‚Äúsage on the stage‚Äù. What that means is, they want to remove the human and emotional factor of teaching children. Eventually, their goal is to have Artificial Intelligence teaching the children in all classrooms across the board. They want to remove a figure that children respect and lookup to, in some cases model after. They‚Äôve requested that teachers stop referring to themselves as teachers, but rather a ‚Äúfacilitator‚Äù. Teachers are being told they are not teaching children, instead they‚Äôre there to ‚Äúfacilitate‚Äù the child‚Äôs learning, and hook them up to online learning. They no longer want teachers (a human) to disseminate information, from the prechosen sites. The commies are controlling the content, how it‚Äôs presented, and what is given to the student. Their vision is to ultimately remove teachers, replace them with a lowly aid. When students attend school, they plug in. \n\nThe human aspect is being stripped away, and they are literally trying to turn our children into commie robots. This is happening everywhere."

    "READ THIS: \"I am a pollster and I find this election to be deeply puzzling.\"\n\n1. \"President Trump received more votes than any previous incumbent seeking reelection. He got 11 million more votes than in 2016, the third largest rise in support ever for an incumbent.\" [Thread 1/13]\n2. \"Trump‚Äôs vote increased so much because, according to exit polls, he performed far better with many key demographic groups. Ninety-five percent of Republicans voted for him.\"\n3. \"He earned the highest share of all minority votes for a Republican since 1960. Trump grew his support among black voters by 50 percent over 2016... Joe Biden‚Äôs black support fell well below 90 percent, the level below which Democratic presidential candidates usually lose.\"\n4. \"Trump increased his share of the national Hispanic vote to 35 percent. With 60 percent or less of the national Hispanic vote, it is arithmetically impossible for a Democratic presidential candidate to win Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico.\"\n5. \"Bellwether states swung further in Trump‚Äôs direction than in 2016. Florida, Ohio and Iowa each defied America‚Äôs media polls with huge wins for Trump. Since 1852, only Richard Nixon has lost the electoral college after winning this trio\"...\n6. \"Midwestern states Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin always swing in the same direction as Ohio and Iowa, their regional peers. Ohio likewise swings with Florida. Current tallies show that, outside of a few cities, the Rust Belt swung in Trump‚Äôs direction.\"\n7. \"Yet, Biden leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin because of an apparent avalanche of black votes in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äòwinning‚Äô margin was derived almost entirely from such voters in these cities\"...\n8. \"... as coincidentally his black vote spiked only in exactly the locations necessary to secure victory. e did not receive comparable levels of support among comparable demographic groups in comparable states, which is highly unusual for the presidential victor.\"\n9. \"We are told that Biden won more votes nationally than any presidential candidate in history. But he won a record low of 17 percent of counties; he only won 524 counties, as opposed to the 873 counties Obama won in 2008. Yet, Biden somehow outdid Obama in total votes.\"\n10. \"Victorious presidential candidates, especially challengers, usually have down-ballot coattails; Biden did not. The Republicans held the Senate and enjoyed a ‚Äòred wave‚Äô in the House, where they gained a large number of seats while winning all 27 toss-up contests.\"\n11. \"Trump‚Äôs party did not lose a single state legislature and actually made gains at the state level.\"\n12. \"Another anomaly is found in the comparison between the polls and non-polling metrics. The latter include: party registrations trends; candidates‚Äô respective primary votes; candidate enthusiasm; social media followings; broadcast and digital media ratings; online searches\"...\n\"Adding to the mystery is a cascade of information about the bizarre manner in which so many ballots were accumulated and counted. The following peculiarities also lack compelling explanations\"... SEE üîª",

The state of Oregon has established a COVID-19 relief fund exclusively for black Oregonians and black-owned businesses to help them navigate through these unprecedented times. According to its website, the ‚ÄúOregon Cares Fund‚Äù is a targeted investment in the black community that comes directly from the CARES Act Coronavirus Relief Fund. Additionally: ‚ÄúThis fund is meant to provide the black community with the resources it needs to weather the global health pandemic and consequent recession. The Oregon Cares Fund is for black people, black-owned businesses, and black community-based organizations.‚Äù The Wall Street Journal reported that back in July, the Oregon Legislature Emergency Board allotted $200 million to assist small businesses suffering losses because of the pandemic and government shutdowns.

Have you ever wondered why the mainstream media and establishment elites are doing everything to stop us? It's because Proud Boys represent Western Values, not Nazism or Fascism! We believe in Free Speech, we believe in farmers and small businesses, we believe in family values and a hard days work with fair pay! We believe in antiquated terms like loyalty, tradition, friendship, freedom and honour! We are the average bloke who has had enough of leftist \"Cancel Culture\" this is literally how the Proud Boys came to be! The Proud Boys are going to be here forever, we are a Black and Yellow giant who cannot be stopped!"

The chaos of an impeachment trial is hardly the peaceful and orderly transition of power both parties assure you they want. So why are they doing this?

At this point, it's worth recalling that for decades, and not that long ago, the two most powerful Democrats in the United States Senate were Ted Kennedy and Robert Byrd. Ted Kennedy left a young woman to drown in a drunk driving accident. Robert Byrd was a recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan. Democrats did not seem bothered by any of that. They praised Kennedy and Byrd at every turn, including at their funerals."

Junior Minister for European Union Affairs Clement Beaune said he was ‚Äúshocked‚Äù to see a private company make such an important decision. ‚ÄúThis should be decided by citizens, not by a CEO,‚Äù he told Bloomberg TV on Monday. ‚ÄúThere needs to be public regulation of big online platforms.‚Äù Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire earlier said that the state should be responsible for regulations, rather than ‚Äúthe digital oligarchy,‚Äù and called big tech ‚Äúone of the threats‚Äù to democracy. Bloomberg\n\nMexico\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, better known as AMLO, was one of the first global leaders to trash tech monopolies for de-platforming the president.\n\n‚ÄúHow can you censor someone: ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs see, I, as the judge of the Holy Inquisition, will punish you because I think what you‚Äôre saying is harmful,'‚Äù AMLO said during a long diatribe last week. ‚ÄúWhere is the law, where is the regulation, what are the norms?

However, from the most recent modification, three-quarters of the parliamentarians will need to vote to approve the modifications.\n\n\"The legislation establishes what we call a constitutional blockade to prevent the legalization of abortion in Honduras in the coming years,\" said official deputy and vice president of Congress, Mario P√©rez, during the virtual session.\"\n \n",

The crash happened Saturday morning on I-94 at the Zoo Interchange. It was captured on Wisconsin Department of Transportation camera video. The Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office said a pickup truck traveling on I-94 when the driver skidded off the eastbound to the southbound ramp. The video appears to show the truck hitting a snowbank on the right shoulder seconds before the fall. When deputies arrived, they found the pickup upright. Two people were helping the driver, who was conscious and breathing. The sheriff's office said he did not show signs of impairment. He was taken to an area hospital to be evaluated. I-94 westbound and all of the ramps were closed for several hours. No other details have been released."

The judge overseeing many of these cases is a Pakistani Muslim. \n\nMust be surreal to spend 20 years being told by your government that Muslims are terrorists and your enemy only to come home and be accused of being a traitor and a terrorist by the federal government's Muslim token.
